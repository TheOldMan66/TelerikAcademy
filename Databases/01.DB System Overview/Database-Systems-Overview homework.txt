1. What database models do you know?
 - hierarchical, graph, relational, Object-oriented.
 
2. Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?
 - tables and relations between them, constrains, can perfom:
    - creating/alerting/deleting tables
    - creating/deleting/alerting relations
    - creating/alerting/deleting/searching data
    - administration, backup/restore, transactions
    - SQL language

3. Define what is "table" in database terms.
  - sequence of rows with same structure of columns. Every column contain same data type (text, numbers, date e.t.c.). Structure is also called "table schema".


4. Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
  - primary key is unique in table, unique identifiyng one row. Can be constructed with data from one or more columns (composite primary key).
  - foreign key is a pointer(relation) to record in another (or same) table.

5. Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
  - one-to-many, many-to-many, one-to-one,


6. When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?
  - when all repeated data is extracted to external table and one row contain only element related data
  - remove repeated data, easy modifiying.


7. What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
  - constraints restrict data in column. 
  - check constraint Used to deny invalid (but allowable by data type) data entering in table. - human age cannot be negative or greater than 150.
  - unique key constraints - deny duplication of data in column.
  - foreign key constraint - foreign key must exist to add data with this foreign key


8. Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
  - pros - speed up searching in data
  - cons - slow down insertion and deletion of data. 


9. What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
  - DDL - Define data
  - DML - Manipulate data


10. What are transactions used for? Give an example.
  - sequence ot operation executed as one. Used to secure processing of all operation or denying all if error is occured in any stage of transaction.
  - example - bank transactions


11. What is a NoSQL database?
  - Non-relational database. No schema for tables/database. Have CRUD operations, indexing...


12. Explain the classical non-relational data models.
  - Document model (JSON based), key/value model, OOP-style ...
  - pros - performance, sclability
  - cons - no data restrictions, no clear document structure.

13. Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
  - Redis - Ultra-fast in-memory data structures server
  - MongoDB - Mature and powerful JSON-document database
  - CouchDB - JSON-based document database with REST API
  - Cassandra - Distributed wide-column database
